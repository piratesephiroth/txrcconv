# txrcconv
Tool for handling txrc files used in some Konami games.  
You can simply drag and drop the .txrc or .txt files on the executable.  
It exports the contents of one or more txrc files to text, one text string per line.  

The text in the file can be edited and converted back to a txrc as long as the amount of strings isn't changed.  
The "header" and "indexes" sections should be left untouched, they are required for rebuilding the txrc file.

**Known games to use this file format:**
- Suikoden Tierkreis
- Love Plus/Love Plus+
- Castlevania Harmony of Despair
