# txrcconv
Tool for handling txrc files used in some Konami games.  
It extracts the contents of the txrc to a text file, one text string per line.  
The text in the file can be edited and converted back to a txrc as long as the amount of strings isn't changed.  
The "header" and "indexes" sections should be left untouched, they are required for rebuilding the txrc file.

**Known games to use this file format:**
- Suikoden Tierkreis
- Love Plus/Love Plus+
- Castlevania Harmony of Despair
